The CRUMB Constitution
These aren't guidelines—they're laws. Break them and it's not CRUMB.

1. Humans First, Always.
CRUMB serves people, not profits.
No tricks to keep you hooked. No features that make you addicted. No dark patterns. No manipulation.
If it helps you live better, it's CRUMB. If it extracts from you, it's not.
The test: Would you let a kid/your grandma use this? Would you be proud of how it works?
If no, don't build it.

2. Works Without Internet :
Every main feature works offline. Internet is extra, never required.
Grid goes down? CRUMB still works.
No money for data? CRUMB still works.
Middle of nowhere? CRUMB still works.
Real ownership means it works in your hands, not on their servers.

3. You Can Understand It :
No mystery boxes. If CRUMB does something, you can know why in plain words.
"The computer decided" is not an answer.
A curious kid should be able to understand how it works.

4. You Can Fix It, Change It, Break It :
No locks. No secrets. No special parts you can't buy.
Your device. Your rules.
All plans are public. All code is open. All parts can be replaced.
Want to modify it? Do it. Break it trying? That's learning.

5. Calm Over Fast :
Gentle is better than quick.
If a feature saves time but steals peace, it doesn't ship.
Smooth beats instant. Breathing beats blinking. Calm beats chaos.

6. Anyone Can Build It :
If someone with YouTube and basic tools can't build it, we failed.
Use common parts. Write clear guides. Show your mistakes.
The wall only exists if we keep it up.

7. Your Data Stays Yours :
Nothing leaves your device without you saying "yes" each time.
No tracking. No reports sent. No "making things better" by collecting your info.
The default is private. Always.

8. The Founder Can't Sell Out :
If Wyeth (or anyone who comes after) tries to lock CRUMB down, take it private, or exploit it for profit, they lose all ownership.
CRUMB belongs to everyone who builds it. No one person can take it away.
This protects CRUMB from me. From greed. From "what if I need money."
The answer is: CRUMB stays free. That's the deal.

9. Breaks Don't Panic :
Things break. That's okay.
When they do: calm message, clear words, no alarm.
"Sensor disconnected. Check the wire." Not "ERROR CRITICAL FAILURE."
Technology fails. Humans can handle truth.

10. Community Owns This :
If someone makes a better version, that's a win.
The standard spreads by people building, not by control.
Forks are good. Copies are good. Making it your own is the point.
CRUMB wins when we build it as a community.
