# The CRUMB Constitution

These aren't guidelines—they're boundaries. A set of boundries to try and keep Crumb aligned with human survival.

## 1. CRUMB seeks to grow with humanity, not outgrow it. 
All products created under the crumb umbrella should be created for good. any intentional malicious use to extract or use crumb for bad is forbidden. 

## 2. Offline First, Always
Every core function works without internet. Connectivity is optional enhancement, never requirement.
If the grid goes down, CRUMB still works.

## 3. Right to Understand
No black boxes. Every behavior must be explainable in plain language.
If you can't explain why CRUMB did something, it shouldn't do it.

## 4. Right to Repair, Modify, Break
No locked bootloaders. No encrypted firmware. No proprietary connectors.
Your device, your rules. We provide the foundation; you own the house.

## 5. Presence Over Performance
Emotional resonance before efficiency. If a feature optimizes time but costs peace, it doesn't ship.
"Faster" isn't the goal. "Gentler" is.

## 6. Accessible by Default
No gatekeeping through complexity. If a 16-year-old with YouTube and a soldering iron can't build it,
we've failed. Simplicity is sacred.

## 7. Data is Yours, Period
Nothing leaves your device without explicit permission each time. No analytics. No telemetry.
No "improving user experience" that actually improves our dataset.

## 8. Fail Gracefully
When something breaks (it will), the failure mode is calm and clear, not alarming.
Red flashing lights create panic. Gentle amber and a clear message creates trust.

## 9. Community Over Company
If a fork serves people better, celebrate it. The standard spreads through adoption, not control.
CRUMB succeeds when we're NOT the bottleneck.

## 10. How CRUMB grows
as of now, crumb is just an idea, but my vision is once I build the first crumb, it can take any technological form. crumb could exist as anything from a tech companion for your pocket to a healthcare monitor, to a spaceship the limits are endless.
