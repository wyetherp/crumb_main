CRUMB
Technology that adapts to you

What This Is :
CRUMB is a platform for building companion devices that work with your rhythms, not against them.
Start simple: ESP32 microcontroller with a heartbeat LED
Cost: $12 for the board
Build time: Plug in USB, upload code
Then expand: Add buttons, sensors, displays—whatever you need
Like Arduino, but for devices that feel alive and respect your pace.

Quick Start
Genesis (The Minimal Version)

Get an ESP32 board (~$12)
Plug it into your computer
Upload the heartbeat code
Watch it breathe

That's it. You just built technology that feels alive.
What's Next?

Add an external LED (learn basic wiring)
Add a button (learn input)
Add a sensor (learn expansion)
Build whatever you need

Full build guide + video: Coming Thanksgiving weekend

Why CRUMB Exists
Most technology forces you to adapt to it. CRUMB adapts to you.

No tracking — Your data stays with you
No subscriptions — You own it completely
No complexity as gatekeeping — If you can plug in a USB cable, you can build this
No closed systems — Modify anything, build anything

Technology should help you be more human, not less.

The Mission
Break down the wall between people who can build technology and everyone else.
Every person who builds CRUMB and understands how it works is one less person dependent on closed systems.
