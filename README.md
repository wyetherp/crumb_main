# CRUMB

**Instead of selling you a device, I'm going to teach you how to build one.**

## The Problem

Technology is a black box. There could be a hamster on a wheel inside your phone and you'd never know.

We're surrounded by computers - phones, cars, speakers, everything - and we're taught to treat them like magic. Don't touch. Don't ask. Just consume.

But here's the secret: **every computer ever made follows the same pattern.**

```
Input → Process → Output
```

Your phone takes a tap, figures out what you meant, shows you the result. A $12 microcontroller does the same thing. The only difference is complexity. And complexity, you can learn.

## What CRUMB Is

CRUMB is a free, open-source tutorial that teaches you to program a computer in 15 minutes.

You'll make an LED pulse like a heartbeat. That's it. That's Genesis Zero.

But here's why it matters: **once you can make a light blink, you can control anything.** Buttons, sensors, displays, motors - the pattern is the same.

This isn't a product. It's a foundation.

- **Genesis Zero**: Wake up the brain (the LED pulses)
- **Genesis One**: Give it senses (add sensors)
- **Genesis Two**: Let it speak (add display/output)
- **Genesis ∞**: Build whatever you need

A meditation timer. A plant monitor that texts you. A custom game controller. A companion that sits on your desk. The choice is yours.

## What You Need

- **ESP32 board** (~$12 on Amazon, search "ESP32 DevKit")
- **USB cable** (data transfer, not just charging)
- **Chrome or Edge browser**

That's it. No software to install. No experience required.

## Start Here

### [→ wyetherp.com](https://wyetherp.com)

1. Plug in the ESP32
2. Click "Flash Genesis Zero"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Watch it pulse

**You just programmed a computer.**

## The Philosophy

CRUMB is:

- **Free.** No subscription. No upsell. No ads.
- **Open source.** See every line of code. Modify it. Share it.
- **Non-profit.** This exists to teach, not to extract.

The world doesn't need another gadget you buy, use, and throw away. It needs people who understand how the gadget works in the first place.

## Your Unfair Advantage

You have AI. Previous generations didn't.

Stuck at 2am? AI is awake. Don't understand an error? AI explains it in 10 seconds. Feel stupid asking? AI doesn't judge.

The best teacher of a computer is another computer.

## Troubleshooting

**Web flash didn't work?**
- Try a different USB cable (must support data, not just power)
- Try holding the BOOT button while flashing
- Paste the error into ChatGPT or Claude - they'll fix it
- The nuclear option is switch to the Arduino IDE, however this is a rather complicated step

**Still stuck?** Open an issue or start a discussion.
