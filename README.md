CRUMB

Build an AI companion from scratch. Understand every component. Own what you make.

Instead of selling you a device, I'm teaching you to build one.

What This Is

CRUMB is a free, open-source curriculum that takes you from "What's inside a computer?" to "I just built a device that talks to AI."
15 videos. $30 in parts. Zero to AI companion.
No prior experience required. No software engineering degree. No magic.
Just a complete path from absolute fundamentals to a working, intelligent device you built yourself.

The Curriculum

📗 Earth Book (Foundation)
Understand how computers actually work. Bits, binary, your first program, buttons.
🔥 Fire Book (Sensing)
Add sensors. Your computer learns to see, feel, and detect presence.
🌊 Water Book (Connectivity)
Connect to WiFi. Pull real-time data. Talk to AI language models.
💨 Air Book (Independence) — Coming Summer 2026
Battery power. Custom PCB. 3D-printed case. Standalone companion.
Watch in order. Each video builds on the last. Skip one, you'll be lost.

What You'll Build

By the end, you'll have a palm-sized device that:

Runs on battery power (8+ hours untethered)
Senses its environment (motion, temperature, distance)
Connects to the internet (WiFi, APIs, AI models)
Responds to your presence
Fits in your pocket

And you'll understand how every piece works.

What You Need

To start:

ESP32 board (~$8-12, search "ESP32 DevKit" on Amazon)
USB cable (data transfer, not just charging)
Chrome or Edge browser

Eventually:

Sensors (~$10 total)
LCD display (~$5)
Battery + components (~$10)

Total investment: ~$30 for the complete build.

Start with "What's Inside A Computer?"
Watch in order through Earth → Fire → Water
Build along as you go
Ask AI when you get stuck

Each video is 1-3 minutes. No fluff. Just what you need to know.

Why This Exists

Technology isn't magic. It's just knowledge you don't have yet.
The gap between "people who build technology" and "everyone else" is artificial. It's maintained through:

Complexity that serves business models, not understanding
Documentation written for experts, not learners
Devices designed to be replaced, not repaired

CRUMB breaks that wall.

This curriculum exists because my brother Luke deserved technology that worked for him. And because everyone deserves to understand the devices they depend on.

The Philosophy

Platform over product.
CRUMB succeeds when you build something I never imagined. Meditation timer, plant monitor, accessibility device, custom controller—the foundation is the same.
Open source forever.

GPL-3.0. You can build it, modify it, sell it. Just keep the knowledge flowing.
Teaching over selling.

No paywalls. No subscriptions. No ads. Just education, freely shared.

Your Unfair Advantage

You have AI. Previous generations didn't.
Get stuck at 2am? AI is awake.
Don't understand an error? AI explains in 30 seconds.
Feel dumb asking? AI doesn't judge.
The best teacher of a computer is another computer.
This is the easiest time in history to learn this. The wall is lower than ever.

Troubleshooting

Can't get code to upload?

Try a different USB cable (must support data)
Try a different USB port
Paste the error into ChatGPT/Claude—they'll debug it

Video unclear?

Ask AI to explain the concept differently
Open a GitHub discussion

Completely stuck?

Open an issue with: what you tried, what happened, what you expected
The community (and I) will help


What Success Looks Like

CRUMB succeeds when:

You build Genesis Zero and realize "I can do this"
You modify CRUMB for a need I never imagined
You fix your device instead of replacing it
You teach someone else to build

CRUMB fails when:

Documentation assumes expertise
The community gatekeeps
We prioritize features over clarity

If you see this happening, call it out. Open an issue. This only works if we keep it accessible.

License
GPL-3.0
Build it. Modify it. Sell it. Share it. Just keep it open.
The knowledge belongs to everyone.

You're a builder now. Go build something.
