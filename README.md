CRUMB
Open hardware platform for building technology that adapts to you

The Wall
There's a wall in technology. On one side: people who can build, modify, and truly understand their devices. On the other: everyone else, forced to accept what corporations decide they need.
This wall is artificial. Maintained through locked bootloaders, deliberately complex documentation, and the myth that understanding technology requires a CS degree.
CRUMB exists to break this wall down.

What This Is
CRUMB isn't a product—it's a foundation. Think Arduino, but for building companion devices.
The hardware is simple: an ESP32 microcontroller, some LEDs, a few buttons. About $40 in parts, one hour of your time.
Once you build it, you understand it. Once you understand it, you can make it do anything:

A meditation timer that doesn't track you
A focus companion that respects your pace
An offline AI assistant
A plant monitor
A Pomodoro timer
Something no one's built yet

The platform is simple because complexity is gatekeeping. The code is open because locked systems serve corporations, not people. Everything's documented because "you wouldn't understand" is a lie.

How to Build
You'll Need

ESP32 development board (~$8)
LED matrix or strip (~$12)
A few tactile buttons (~$5)
USB-C cable
Basic soldering skills (or a friend who has them)

Total cost: ~$40
Get Started

Understand the philosophy → Read why CRUMB exists
Build the hardware → Build Guide (full guide coming end of November)
Flash the firmware → Examples (heartbeat example coming soon)
Make it yours → Modify, extend, break, rebuild

Video build guide coming Thanksgiving weekend.

How to Extend
CRUMB grows with you:
Hardware:

Add sensors (temperature, motion, light)
Connect multiple CRUMBs together
Design custom cases
Build your own PCB

Software:

Modify LED patterns
Add new interaction modes
Connect to other devices
Write your own firmware from scratch

Everything you need is in the repo. Schematics, code, examples, failures documented.

The Mission
Technology should bridge you to what matters, not extract attention from it.
CRUMB follows a Constitution that keeps it aligned with humans:

Human pace, not machine pace — No manufactured urgency
Offline first, always — Core functions work without connectivity
Right to repair, modify, break — You own it completely
Presence over performance — Calm is more valuable than fast
Data is yours, period — Nothing leaves your device without permission

Every person who builds a CRUMB and understands how it works is one less person on the wrong side of the wall.
Every device modified for a specific need proves technology can serve humans, not shareholders.
Every project that wouldn't exist in a closed system is a win for what technology could be.

Current State
Alpha. Expect rough edges. Expect them documented.
What's Working:

Hardware design (ESP32-based, modular)
Core philosophy and constitution
Project structure

Coming Soon:

Step-by-step build guide (target: end of November)
Firmware examples (starting with heartbeat animation)
Video documentation (Thanksgiving weekend)
Bill of materials with supplier links
Hardware schematics

Coming Eventually:

3D printable cases
PCB designs
Expansion modules
Community showcase


How to Contribute
CRUMB succeeds when we're NOT the bottleneck.
Ways to help:

Build one → Document your process, share what worked
Break something → Report what failed (and how to fix it)
Dream bigger → Suggest what's missing
Teach others → Build community
Design hardware → Create cases, boards, expansions
Write code → Add examples, fix bugs, build libraries

Contributing guide coming soon. For now: open an issue or start a discussion.

Platform, Not Product
Like Arduino. Like Linux. Like Wikipedia.
The value isn't what we build directly—it's what you build on the foundation we provide.
We maintain the standard. You create the future.
If a fork serves people better, we celebrate it. If someone builds something we didn't imagine, we document it. If the community outgrows us, we've succeeded.

License
GPL-3.0 — You can build, modify, sell, or distribute. The only requirement: keep it open. keep it nice.
See LICENSE for details.

Open an Issue for bugs or features
Start a Discussion for questions
Email: wja326@lehigh.edu

We build in the open. Questions are encouraged.

The wall only exists if we accept it.
Build. Share. Teach. Repeat.
