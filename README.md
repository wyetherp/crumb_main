# CRUMB

An open platform for building companions that help you survive/can do cool stuff

## What This Is

CRUMB isn't a product—it's a foundation. Like Arduino, but for building devices that sit with you through hard moments.

The hardware is simple: an ESP32, some LEDs, a few buttons. Once you build it, you control what it becomes—a meditation timer, a focus companion, an offline AI assistant, whatever your experience needs.

## Why This Exists

My brother Luke showed me how bad moderin interfaces are. Watching him struggle with interfaces designed for perfect minds showed me: technology should adapt to humans, not force humans to adapt.

Most "smart" devices optimize for engagement. CRUMB optimizes for presence.

## Get Started

**Want to build one?**  
→ [Build Guide](docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md)

**Want to understand the philosophy?**  
→ [Philosophy](PHILOSOPHY.md)

**Want to see what's possible?**  
→ [Community Showcase](community/SHOWCASE.md)

**Want to modify or extend?**  
→ [Firmware Guide](docs/FIRMWARE_GUIDE.md)

## The Laws

CRUMB follows a [Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) that keeps it aligned with human flourishing:
- Human pace, not machine pace
- Offline first, always
- Right to repair, modify, break
- Presence over performance
- Data is yours, period

Read the full constitution before contributing.

## Current State

**Alpha.** Expect rough edges.

Working:
- Core hardware design
- Basic firmware framework
- Example implementations

In progress:
- Comprehensive build guide
- Firmware library expansion
- Community showcase

## Contribute

Not just code. We need:
- **Builders:** Document your build, share what worked
- **Testers:** Report what broke (and how)
- **Dreamers:** Suggest what's missing
- **Teachers:** Improve the docs
