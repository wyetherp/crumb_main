Why CRUMB Exists

The wall between "people who build technology" and "everyone else" is artificial.
It's maintained through:

Complexity that serves business models, not understanding
Documentation written for experts, not learners
Devices designed to be replaced, not repaired
The assumption that "normal people" shouldn't need to know how things work

CRUMB exists to break that wall.

The Realization

I wanted to understand how my iPad worked. Not "how to use it"—how the THING ITSELF worked.
So I started digging. And I realized: I could build this.
Not easily. Not quickly. But the components? Available. The knowledge? Documented.
The only difference between me and the people who built it? They already knew. I didn't yet.
Technology isn't magic. It's just knowledge you don't have access to. Yet.

Why I Built This

My brother Luke showed me how limited most technology is.
Most interfaces assume everyone's brain works the same way. Most devices break easily and can't be fixed. Most tech forces you to adapt to IT, not the other way around.

I built CRUMB because Luke deserved better. And so do you.

The Mission

Teach anyone to build a computer from absolute zero.
Not "follow these steps and hope it works." Actually understand:

What's happening inside the components
Why each line of code matters
How to fix it when something breaks

Once you've built one thing, you realize you can build anything.

What CRUMB Actually Is

CRUMB isn't a product you buy. It's a foundation you build on.
The curriculum:

Earth Book: Fundamentals (bits, binary, first program, buttons)
Fire Book: Sensing (LCD, sensors, motion detection)
Water Book: Connectivity (WiFi, APIs, AI integration)
Air Book: Independence (battery, PCB, case, standalone device)

15 videos. $30 in parts. Zero to AI companion.

Start with "What's inside a computer?" End with "I built a device that talks to AI."
Same $12 microcontroller throughout. Different capabilities at each stage.

Platform Over Product

CRUMB succeeds when we're NOT the bottleneck.
Like Arduino. Like Linux. Like Wikipedia.
The value isn't what I build directly—it's what YOU build on the foundation I provide.
Some people will build meditation timers. Others will build plant monitors, focus tools, accessibility devices, or things I haven't imagined yet.
You maintain the build. You create the future.

Why Open Source Matters

Open source isn't just a license. It's a statement: This knowledge belongs to all of us.
When you open-source hardware:

You can fix it (no "warranty void" stickers)
You can modify it (no locked bootloaders)
You can learn from it (no hidden documentation)
You can build on it (no permission required)

GPL-3.0: You can build it, sell it, modify it, keep it private while developing. Just: if you distribute, share the source. Keep the knowledge flowing.
This isn't anti-profit. It's pro-knowledge.

The Unfair Advantage (Why Now)

You have AI. Previous generations didn't.
Before: Get stuck → Google for hours → Maybe find an answer
Now: Get stuck → Ask AI → Get explanation in 30 seconds → Get working code
The best teacher of a computer is another computer.
AI doesn't judge. It doesn't gatekeep. It just explains, rewrites, debugs, teaches.
This is the easiest time in history to learn this. The wall is lower than ever.

How to Build Along

Start here: https://www.youtube.com/@Wyetherp-1 → Earth Book 1
Watch in order. Each video builds on the last. Skip one, you'll be lost.
You don't need:

A CS degree
Prior programming experience
Expensive tools
Permission

You need:

$12 for the first chip
15 minutes for Genesis Zero
Curiosity about how things actually work


What Success Looks Like

CRUMB succeeds when:

Someone builds Genesis Zero and realizes "I can do this"
A parent and kid build it together and both learn
Someone modifies CRUMB for a need I never imagined
A teacher uses it to show students computers aren't magic
Someone fixes their CRUMB instead of throwing it away

CRUMB fails when:

Documentation assumes expertise
The community becomes gatekeeping
We prioritize features over clarity
We forget technology should adapt to humans, not vice versa


The Luke Test

Every design decision asks:

Physical resilience - Can you break it easily? (If yes, redesign)
Interface simplicity - Would someone struggle to use this? (If yes, simplify)
Repair clarity - Can you fix it without specialized tools? (If no, rethink)

This isn't just accessibility. It's honesty.
Technology that breaks easily, confuses users, and can't be repaired isn't serving humans. It's serving planned obsolescence.

Start Building

The wall only exists if we accept it.
Technology that adapts to you. Knowledge that belongs to everyone.
Build. Share. Teach. Repeat.

Made by Wyeth Anzilotti

Because my brother deserved technology that worked for him

Because everyone deserves to understand their devices

Because the wall is artificial and we can break it
