## The Wall

There's a wall in technology. On one side: people who can build, modify, understand their devices. On the other: everyone else, forced to accept what corporations decide is "user-friendly."

This wall is artificial. It's maintained through:
- Locked bootloaders and proprietary firmware
- Deliberately complex documentation
- "Warranty void if removed" stickers
- The myth that understanding technology requires a CS degree

**CRUMB exists to break this wall down.**

## Technology as a Human Right

You should be able to:
- Understand how your devices work
- Fix them when they break
- Modify them for your needs
- Build new ones from scratch

Not because you're "technical"—because you're human and curious.

CRUMB is designed like Arduino: simple enough to learn, powerful enough to matter, open enough to own.

## What CRUMB Actually Does

CRUMB doesn't do one thing. It's a foundation.

Some people will build meditation timers. Others will build focus tools, offline AI assistants, notification managers, mood trackers, reminder systems, plant monitors, or things we haven't imagined yet.

The hardware is deliberately simple: if you can follow a recipe, you can build CRUMB. Once you've built it, you understand it. Once you understand it, you can make it do anything a microcontroller can do—which is almost anything.

## Platform Over Product

CRUMB succeeds when we're NOT the bottleneck.

Like Arduino, like Linux, like Wikipedia—the value isn't what we build directly. It's what you build on the foundation we provide.

We maintain the standard. You create the future.

If a fork serves people better, we celebrate it. If someone builds something we didn't imagine, we document it. If the community outgrows us, we've succeeded.

**##The Luke test**
1. CRUMB seeks to be physically resiliant. if you can break it its too fragile, a CRUMB should be built to last
2. 

## The Path Forward

Breaking down the wall requires:
1. **Simple foundations** - CRUMB is easy to build because complexity is gatekeeping
2. **Clear documentation** - Written for humans who are learning, not experts showing off
3. **Public failures** - We document what didn't work so you don't waste time repeating our mistakes
4. **Community ownership** - The platform belongs to everyone who builds on it

Every person who builds a CRUMB and understands how it works is one less person on the wrong side of the wall.

Every device that gets modified for a specific need is proof that technology can serve humans, not corporations.

Every project that wouldn't exist in a closed system is a win for what technology could be.

## Why Open Source Matters

Open source isn't just a license—it's resistance.

Against planned obsolescence. Against subscription lock-in. Against "you're holding it wrong." Against the idea that you need permission to understand your own devices.

When you open source hardware, you're saying: this belongs to all of us. You can fix it, mod it, improve it, learn from it, build on it.

## Start Here

You don't need to be "technical" to build CRUMB. You need to be curious.

You don't need a CS degree to modify it. You need to want it to do something different.

You don't need permission to break the wall. You just need to start building.

The wall only exists if we accept it.
