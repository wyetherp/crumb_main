The Realization

I wanted to understand how my iPad worked.

Not "how to use it"—I knew that. I wanted to understand how the THING ITSELF worked. How touching glass made pixels move. How code became action.
So I started digging. And I realized: I could build this.
Not easily. Not quickly. But the components? Available. The knowledge? Documented. The only difference between me and the people who built it? They already knew. I didn't yet.

That's when it hit me: technology isn't magic. It's just knowledge I didn't have access to.

The Wall
There's a gap between "people who build technology" and "everyone else."

This gap isn't natural. It's maintained.
Not through evil schemes—just through:

Complexity that serves business models, not users
Documentation written for experts, not learners
Systems designed to be replaced, not repaired
The quiet assumption that "normal people" shouldn't need to understand this

Most people think technology is too complicated for them. It's not. It's just been presented that way.
What CRUMB Believes
Knowing how technology works should be a human right.
Not because everyone needs to become an engineer.
Because in 2025, technology mediates almost everything:

How you communicate
How you work
How you learn
How you remember
How you exist in the world

If you don't understand the systems you depend on, you're at their mercy.
CRUMB exists to change that. Not by tearing down big tech. But by making the knowledge accessible.
The Mission
Break the wall between "people who build technology" and "everyone else."
Not by making technology simpler (it is what it is).
But by making the PATH TO UNDERSTANDING clearer.
CRUMB teaches you to build a computer because:

Building forces understanding in a way reading never will
Once you've built one thing, you realize you can build anything
Once you CAN build, you stop accepting what you're given

You don't need permission to understand your own devices. You just need a starting point.
What CRUMB Actually Is
CRUMB isn't a product. It's a foundation.
Some people will build meditation timers. Others will build plant monitors, focus tools, notification managers, custom controllers, or things we haven't imagined yet.
The hardware is deliberately simple: If you can follow a recipe, you can build CRUMB.
The progression is intentional:

Genesis Zero: You learn the computer CAN control light
Genesis One: You learn YOU can control WHERE the light is
Genesis Two+: You learn you can control WHAT the light responds to

Each step removes one layer of mystery. After Genesis Zero, computers aren't black boxes anymore. They're tools you understand.
Platform Over Product
CRUMB succeeds when we're NOT the bottleneck.
Like Arduino, like Linux, like Wikipedia—the value isn't what we build directly. It's what YOU build on the foundation we provide.
We maintain the standard. You create the future.
If a fork serves people better, we celebrate it. If someone builds something we didn't imagine, we document it. If the community outgrows us, we've succeeded.
The goal isn't to own the ecosystem. It's to make the ecosystem possible.
The Luke Test
My brother Luke showed me how limited most technology is.

The Luke Test:

Physical resilience - If you can break it easily, it's too fragile. A CRUMB should be built to last.
Interface simplicity - If Luke (or anyone) would struggle to use it, the interface fails.
Repair clarity - If something breaks, you should be able to fix it without specialized tools or secret knowledge.

This isn't just about accessibility. It's about honesty.
Technology that breaks easily, confuses users, and can't be repaired isn't serving humans. It's serving planned obsolescence.
CRUMB is physically tough, easy to use, and completely repairable. That's not optional—it's foundational.
Why Open Source Matters
Open source isn't just a license. It's a statement:
This knowledge belongs to all of us.
When you open source hardware, you're saying:

You can fix it (no "warranty void" stickers)
You can modify it (no locked bootloaders)
You can learn from it (no hidden documentation)
You can build on it (no permission required)

GPL-3.0 specifically: You can build it, modify it, sell it, keep it private while developing. Just: if you distribute it, share the source. Keep the knowledge flowing.
This isn't anti-profit. It's pro-knowledge.
Companies can still make money (Red Hat, Arduino, Raspberry Pi all prove this). But they can't monopolize understanding.
The Unfair Advantage (Why Now)
You have AI. Previous generations didn't.
This changes everything.
Before: You get stuck → Google for hours → Maybe find an answer → Maybe understand it
Now: You get stuck → Ask AI → Get explanation in 30 seconds → Get working code if needed
The best teacher of a computer is another computer.
AI doesn't judge you for not knowing. It doesn't get impatient. It doesn't gatekeep. It just explains, rewrites, debugs, teaches.
This is why NOW is the easiest time in history to learn this. The wall is lower than it's ever been.
What Success Looks Like
CRUMB succeeds when:

Someone builds Genesis Zero and realizes "I can do this"
A parent and kid build it together and both learn something
Someone modifies CRUMB for a need we never imagined
A teacher uses CRUMB to show students technology isn't magic
Someone fixes their CRUMB instead of throwing it away

CRUMB fails when:

It's too complicated for beginners
Documentation assumes expertise
The community becomes gatekeeping
We prioritize features over clarity
We forget the Luke Test

Start Here
You don't need to be "technical." You need to be curious.
You don't need a CS degree. You need to want to understand.
You don't need permission. You just need $12, 15 minutes, and willingness to try.
The wall only exists if we accept it.

Technology that adapts to you. Knowledge that belongs to everyone.
Build. Share. Teach. Repeat.

Made by Wyeth Anzilotti
Because my brother deserved technology that worked for him
Because everyone deserves to understand their devices
Because the wall is artificial and we can break it
